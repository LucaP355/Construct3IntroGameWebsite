<h1>Instructions</h1>

<p>To play the game, it's just like soccer or "international football." You have to get the ball in the other player's goal.</p>

<p>You use the Arrow keys to control Player 1 and ASWD to control Player 2. Controllers can be supported via other programs, such as JoyToKey or UsendMii. Just set the keybinds on the emulator and you have controller support.</p>
